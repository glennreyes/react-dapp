# React Dapp Workshop

Welcome to the React Dapp workshop! This workshop will teach you how to build a decentralized application (Dapp) using React and the Ethereum blockchain. We will be using the [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/) to build our Dapp.

## Getting started

1. Get started by cloning this project and installing the dependencies:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/glennreyes/react-dapp.git
cd react-dapp
pnpm install
```

2. Start the development server:

```sh
pnpm dev
```

3. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser and follow the instructions on the screen.
